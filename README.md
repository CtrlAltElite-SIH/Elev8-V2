# About
We will be building a web application to provide a common platform for potential start-ups, mentors/experts and students. Through this application, start-ups can approach mentors or experts for necessary help in the required domain. This will be very helpful for early-stage start-ups. They can also start crowdfunding to get some financial help. This platform will also provide students with an opportunity to work with start-ups on real-world projects. Working with start-ups would help students to get industry exposure at an early age. Mentors and experts can guide grass-root level start-ups through their blogs and articles. As these start-ups grow, more and more jobs will be created. This will have a direct positive impact on the county's economy. We hope that this application has the potential to bring about a drastic change in the success rate of start-ups in our country.
